Example PHP project
===================

The purpose of this repository is to show how to use GitLab CI to do
continuous integration with a PHP project.

Here is a sample status icon showing the state of the master branch:

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/todorvt/Testing/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/todorvt/Testing/-/commits/master)

End a sample status icon showing the test coverage report:

[![coverage report](https://gitlab.com/todorvt/Testing/badges/master/coverage.svg)](https://gitlab.com/todorvt/Testing/-/commits/master)

Every push will then trigger a new build on GitLab CI.

(Don't forget to update the badge url in the README to point to your own GitLab project.)
